  <h2>When the Prairie Calls Me Home</h2>
  <em>&copy; David van Coolwijk 2025</em>
  <pre>
(Verse 1)
The wind rolls in from the open plain
Dust on my boots, sun on my face again
The saddle creaks like an old refrain
Callin’ me back where I’ve always been

(Verse 2)
Mama’s voice in a whisperin’ breeze
Papa’s old hat hangin’ in the trees
There’s a place out there that knows my name
And it’s callin’ me home again

(Chorus)
When the prairie calls me home
Through the wheat fields where I used to roam
I hear the coyotes cry and the wild geese moan
And I know I ain’t alone
Yeah, when the prairie calls me home

(Verse 3)
That ol’ fence line still leans to the west
Just like my heart when it needs to rest
I tried the city but I lost my song
Now the wide open sky’s where I belong

(Bridge)
Each mile I ride, I feel it more
The roots I planted, the life I swore
To never forget where I came from
Where the stars still shine when the day is done

(Final Chorus)
When the prairie calls me home
Through the golden grass and the buffalo bones
Where my story’s carved in the hills of stone
And my heart finds peace alone
Yeah, when the prairie calls me home
  </pre>

  <h2>Where the River Forgets My Name</h2>
  <em>&copy; David van Coolwijk 2025</em>
  <pre>
(Verse 1)
The night rolls in like a long-lost friend,
Bringing back voices I can’t defend.
A half-empty bottle, a heart full of ghosts,
I drink to the things that I miss the most.

(Verse 2)
The sound of her laughter, the touch of her hand,
Slipped through my fingers like dry desert sand.
Took all the love, left all the pain,
Now I’m here drowning in memories again.

(Chorus)
Whiskey and old regrets,
Pour another round, I ain't done yet.
Every sip burns like the tears I’ve shed,
For the life I lost and the words unsaid.

(Verse 3)
I drive these roads with the radio low,
Chasing the past where the wild winds blow.
But the rearview mirror only shows time,
And a man who let go of all that was mine.

(Chorus)
Whiskey and old regrets,
Pour another round, I ain't done yet.
Every sip burns like the tears I’ve shed,
For the life I lost and the words unsaid.

(Outro)
I hear your voice in the river’s song,
Telling me, boy, it’s time to move on.
But the river forgets what I can’t change,
And I’m still here, whispering your name.
  </pre>

  <h2>Dancing Through My Heart</h2>
  <em>&copy; David van Coolwijk 2025</em>
  <pre>
(Verse 1 – The Beginning)
You came into this world, so small and sweet
Ten tiny toes and a heartbeat I could feel
Wrapped you in my arms, couldn't believe
How something so little could change everything
...
(Outro)
My love still plays like an old guitar
And you’ll be dancing through my heart
  </pre>

  <h2>A Cowboy's Life</h2>
  <em>&copy; David van Coolwijk 2025</em>
  <pre>
(Verse 1)
Sunrise creepin’ on the open plains,
Boots on the ground, gotta earn my name.
Coffee’s black and the fire’s burnin’,
Another day, another lesson learnin’.

(Verse 2)
Saddle up, it’s time to ride,
Through the dust, through the countryside.
Rope in hand, spurs in sync,
A cowboy’s life ain’t what you think.

(Chorus)
Rollin’ on like tumbleweeds,
Ain’t got much, but I’m set free.
Wide-brim hat and ridin’ high,
Cowboy life until I die.

(Verse 3)
Storm clouds rise, but I stand tall,
Face the wind, I take it all.
From broken bones to busted pride,
A cowboy never runs to hide.

(Verse 4)
Mendin’ fences, breakin’ colts,
Livin’ life by cowboy codes.
Underneath the moon so bright,
Home is where the fire lights.

(Chorus)
Rollin’ on like tumbleweeds,
Ain’t got much, but I’m set free.
Wide-brim hat and ridin’ high,
Cowboy life until I die.

(Bridge)
Some men chase the city lights,
Suits and ties and nine-to-fives.
But I need that endless sky,
Drivin’ cattle, ridin’ high.

(Verse 5)
One last ride before the sun,
One more trail before I’m done.
If I fall, don’t let me lie,
Lay me where the eagles fly.

(Chorus)
Rollin’ on like tumbleweeds,
Ain’t got much, but I’m set free.
Wide-brim hat and ridin’ high,
Cowboy life until I die.

(Outro)
Tip my hat, take one last ride,
Through the hills so big and wide.
When I go, don’t shed no tears,
I’ll be ropin’ clouds for years.
  </pre>

  <h2>My Truck Left Me and Took My Dog</h2>
  <em>&copy; David van Coolwijk 2025</em>
  <pre>
(Verse 1)
Woke up this morning, grabbed my hat,
Reached for my coffee—dog drank that.
Stepped outside, my truck was gone,
Left a note sayin’, “Boy, I’m movin’ on.”

(Pre-Chorus)
Now I ain’t one to get all sad,
But my truck ran off with my dog—that’s bad!

(Chorus)
My truck left me and took my dog,
They’re drivin’ west through morning fog.
Saw ‘em postin’ pics on Instagram,
Truck’s got new rims, dog’s got a tan!

(Verse 2)
Checked my phone, my girl moved out,
Took my boots and my last cold stout.
Even my horse just sighed and left,
Guess that’s what I get for naming him “Jeff.”

(Pre-Chorus)
Now I ain't one to sit and cry,
But Jeff just Ubered—left me dry!

(Chorus)
My truck left me and took my dog,
They’re drivin’ west through morning fog.
Saw ‘em postin’ pics on Instagram,
Truck’s got new rims, dog’s got a tan!

(Bridge)
I called the sheriff, he laughed so hard,
Said, “Son, that’s rough, even for a bard.”
Now I drink alone, in this neon fog,
Writin’ a song ‘bout a truck and a dog.

(Final Chorus)
My truck left me and took my dog,
They’re drivin’ west through morning fog.
Last I heard, they’re happy and free—
My dog’s got a truck, but what’s left of me?
  </pre>

<h2>Cowboys and Sad Songs</h2>
  <em>&copy; David van Coolwijk 2025</em>
  <pre>
(Verse 1)
Rode into town with the sun hangin’ low,
Dust on my boots, nowhere left to go.
The barstool remembers the weight of my sins,
A jukebox confession just playin’ again.

(Verse 2)
I ordered a whiskey, the cheap kind that burns,
A heart full of miles and lessons unlearned.
The waitress, she smiled like she’d seen it before,
Another lost cowboy walkin’ through that door.

(Chorus)
'Cause cowboys and sad songs go hand in hand,
Like broken-down fences and dry desert land.
We chase down the wind, then we drink when it’s gone—
Yeah, cowboys and sad songs just roll right along.

(Verse 3)
She left me in spring, like a wild mustang,
No goodbye letter, no silver ring.
But her ghost still dances in my rearview mirror,
And I still hear her voice like she’s standin’ near.

(Bridge)
The night knows my name, so does the rain,
Every neon shadow still whispers her name.
The more I forget, the clearer she gets,
Like verses I’ve written but haven’t sung yet.

(Final Chorus)
Yeah, cowboys and sad songs ride the same line,
From barrooms to backroads, through heartache and time.
We tip our hats to what we’ve lost and done wrong—
Yeah, cowboys and sad songs just roll right along.
